# Ways of appliying CSS on html file
We can apply CSS on html file by three ways:
- Inline CSS
- Document level/ Internal CSS
- External CSS
## Inline CSS
If you want to give CSS effect only on single line then you can use ```Inline CSS```.
It can be applied by using ```style``` attribute in the respective tag.


**💻Example:**

## Document level/ Internal CSS
As per its name this way of CSS is limited upto a single document.
In this way of CSS, we use CSS properties inside the ```Style tag``` placed between head tag.
With the help of selectors ```Document level/ Internal CSS``` is applied on a single document.

Let's see its examples selector wise:

**💻Example using Tag Name:**
**💻Example using Class Name:**
**💻Example using ID Name:**

## External CSS
When you want to give same CSS effect on multiple files at a time then ``` External``` CSS is used.
It's mostly used while building a project.
In this way of CSS we create a seperate CSS file and link it to the html file.
