# Lecture 17 Building a small website, Farm2Fresh Part 1

## Basic Components of a website:

Like our human body has different body parts, head, neck, hands, legs, etc. A website also has different components:

* Navigation Bar: At the top of a webpage is the Navigation Bar or also called as Navbar.
 Whenever we land on any webpage, Navbar is used to navigate from one page to another of that website.

* Header: Below the Navbar is the Header section.The Header section consist of the main agenda of your website.

* Featured/Features: Below the Header is the featured or features section, consisting of highlighted products or features of 
your website, respectively. 

* Content: After gaining the attention of the users, now you are ready to show them your content.

**Your Homepage must be entrypoint to detailed view** 

The meaning of above line is, if you show everything to the user on the homepage itself, the user won't be able to 
explore everything in detail.

**Myth Busted: It's a popular misconception that a website has only one footer. But actually there are two footers**
1) Navigation Footer: From here also the user can navigate to different pages.
2) The actual Footer: Copyright, etc.

**Note: This is not a standard format to create a website, this is just for your reference of basic components.**
